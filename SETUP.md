# Setup Instructions

It seems Node.js is not installed on your system. `npm` (Node Package Manager) is required to run this project.

## Option 1: Automatic Install (Try this first)
I am attempting to install it for you in the background. If you see a success message in the chat, you can skip this.

## Option 2: Manual Install
If the automatic install fails, please follow these steps:

1.  **Download**: Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the "LTS" version for Windows.
2.  **Install**: Run the installer. Accept all defaults.
3.  **Restart**: **Important!** You must restart your terminal (or VS Code) after installing for the changes to take effect.
4.  **Verify**: Open a new terminal and type `node -v`. If it prints a version number, you are ready.

## After Installation
Once Node.js is installed:

1.  Open the terminal in this directory:
    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Users\Manav Prajith M\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\travelease"
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the app:
    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```
